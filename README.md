# My ai
 This is a simple chatbot or a text-based conversational agent.
 It responds to user inputs using predefined patterns and responses stored in a knowledge base.
 Although it lacks real intelligence and is based on fixed response patterns, it is still designed to provide interactions with users and handle certain queries based on the knowledge it has been provided.
**This ai was not yet trained comepletely, if youre using this please add knowledge to its knowledge base by asking questions you know the answer to and it might not. Thank you.**

Ok this is an example output:
```
You: How do i make a class in python // its not really case sensitive

Ai:
 class MyClass:
   def __init__(self):
     self.did_work="It worked!"
     self.print_res()

   def print_res(self):
     print(self.did_work)

myclass1=MyClass()
```

Now you can enter Run -- again its not case sensitive -- and it will run the previous code:

```
You: Run


Code: 
class MyClass:
   def __init__(self):
     self.did_work="It worked!"
     self.print_res()

   def print_res(self):
     print(self.did_work)

myclass1=MyClass()

Output:
It worked!
```
